Hello, i hope you have a great day.


latest fixes made by me:

*	removing duplicate objects and sprites;
this included things like Obj_player1_1 and Obj_player1_2 and Spr_player1_1 and spr_player1_2. 
This was proably caused when the projects were combined as things with _1 only occured in Rm_lvlselect and
_2 in Rm_lvlselect_error. 
** there are still 2 remaining references to Obj_player1_1 and Obj_player_2_1, these files do not exist and
	i was unable to find where they are referenced from. if you find a reference to them please fix ;).

*	changed naming of lvls
changed the naming of the levels to Rm_lvl_1, Rm_lvl_2,... please use this naming scheme if you want the room
o be recognized by the leveldoors in the selection screen.
also changed the room_exit to reflect the new room naming.
if multiple rooms are used, use the camera to folow thru the lvl or create a tp to a sublvl o Rm_lvl_1a and not
a new lvl
